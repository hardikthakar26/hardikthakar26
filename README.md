**Cloud Infrastructure Engineer | 7+ Years Enterprise IT Experience**

I architect and implement AWS cloud solutions with a focus on operational excellence, cost efficiency, and security. My work bridges the gap between "functional" and "production-ready"—ensuring every deployment is maintainable, cost-optimized, and built for scale.

## Engineering Principles

**Cost-Conscious Architecture**  
Every design decision considers TCO. I architect with billing dashboards open, not as an afterthought.

**Security as Foundation**  
IAM least privilege, network segmentation, and audit logging are built into the foundation—not bolted on later.

**Operational Clarity**  
Complex systems fail. I favor simple, well-documented architectures that teams can confidently maintain and evolve.

## Technical Expertise

| **Cloud Platform** | AWS (EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, CloudWatch, Cost Explorer, CloudFormation) |
| **Systems** | Linux Administration (RHEL/Ubuntu), Bash, Python |
| **Tools & Practices** | Git, Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD, Technical Documentation |
| **Operations** | Root Cause Analysis, Incident Response, Performance Optimization |

## What Sets Me Apart

**Production Experience**  
7 years managing enterprise systems gives me perspective most cloud engineers lack. I understand capacity planning, change management, vendor SLAs, and the difference between a proof-of-concept and a system that runs at 3 AM.

**Business-Aware Engineering**  
I don't just implement technical solutions—I align infrastructure decisions with business objectives, budget constraints, and risk tolerance.

**Documentation-First**  
Every architecture decision is documented with the "why" behind it. Future teams shouldn't need to reverse-engineer my thinking.

## Approach to Cloud

I build labs that simulate real production constraints: limited budgets, security requirements, compliance needs, and operational handoff considerations. 

My repositories demonstrate:
- Cost modeling and optimization strategies
- Security hardening and compliance patterns  
- Disaster recovery and high availability designs
- Clear documentation for knowledge transfer

This isn't tutorial-following—it's production thinking applied systematically.

## Open to Discuss

**Cloud architecture patterns** that balance cost and resilience  
**AWS cost optimization** tactics for real workloads  
**Security governance** in multi-account environments  
**Career transitions** from traditional IT to cloud infrastructure
